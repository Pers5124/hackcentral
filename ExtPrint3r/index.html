<p>2. On the left side, click settings. Change the amount of iframes slider to 10000 (max) and go back.
<p>3. On the tile that says GoGuardian, click the pill-shaped button that says "Disable".</p>

<h4>GG, you did it. No? Go to chrome://restart and try again. (chrome://restart reboots your chromebook without signing you out)</h4>

    <p><a href="launcher.html">Here's the link</a>
<p>Bugs:</p>
<p>Can't click anything? Restart from step 1.<p/>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>If your computer freezes for more that 2 minutes:</p>
<p>You fucked up somewhere in the process.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, teachers can still see your browser history, we're working on a fix for this.</p>
<p>Exploit seems to last longer during the nightly block (2:00 AM to 6:00 AM school days, 12:00 AM to 8:00 AM weekends.)</p>
<p>I have gotten it to last until 6 am (end of block) by closing my computer for about 2 hours with the exploit active, I plan to experiment with this further.</p>
<h2><strong>DO NOT USE IN CLASS</strong></h2>
<p>The school has enforced a policy where if you are on your computer during class, but not visible on GoGuardian, they will <strong>search your computer.</strong></p>
<p>This is an easy way to reveal this exploit's existence to the school and <strong>get it patched.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ONLY USE THIS AT HOME.</strong></p>
