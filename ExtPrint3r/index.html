  <h2>Directions (write these down somewhere, you wont be able to go back here after step 3.):</h2>
<p>1. Click <a target="_blank" href="https://perss51242.github.io/hackcentral/ExtPrint3r/launcher.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>2. On the left side, click settings. Change the amount of iframes slider to 10000 (max) and go back.
<p>3. On the tile that says GoGuardian, click the pill-shaped button that says "Disable".</p>
<p>4. Open chrome://extensions?id=haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh in a new tab. Your tabs should look exactly like this:</p>

<p>5. Press the button labeled "The Print3r" and <b>IMMEDIATELY AFTER</b> press ctrl + 3.</p>
<p>6. There should be a switch labeled "Allow access to file URLs", spam-click the switch for about 5 seconds, then press ctrl + w.</p>
<p>7. You should be on the The Print3r, if you are, press ctrl + p, if not, switch to it, then press ctrl + p. This should open up the print dialog box.</p>
<p>8. Press cancel, if the tab doesn't close on its own, press ctrl + w.</p>
<h4>GG, you did it. No? Go to chrome://restart and try again. (chrome://restart reboots your chromebook without signing you out)</h4>
<h4>How to turn off: Press chrome://restart or wait for the exploit to wear off (yeah it wears off theres nothing i can do about it deal widdit)</h4>
<p>Bugs:</p>
<p>Can't click anything? Restart from step 1.<p/>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>If your computer freezes for more that 2 minutes:</p>
<p>You fucked up somewhere in the process.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, teachers can still see your browser history, we're working on a fix for this.</p>
<p>Exploit seems to last longer during the nightly block (2:00 AM to 6:00 AM school days, 12:00 AM to 8:00 AM weekends.)</p>
<p>I have gotten it to last until 6 am (end of block) by closing my computer for about 2 hours with the exploit active, I plan to experiment with this further.</p>
<h2><strong>DO NOT USE IN CLASS</strong></h2>
<p>The school has enforced a policy where if you are on your computer during class, but not visible on GoGuardian, they will <strong>search your computer.</strong></p>
<p>This is an easy way to reveal this exploit's existence to the school and <strong>get it patched.</strong></p>
<p>ONLY USE THIS AT HOME.</strong></p>
