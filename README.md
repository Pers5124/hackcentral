<h1>Hack Central</h1>
This is a website created by a 13 year old dumbass with the goal to provide games, hacks, and other things to students using school computer monitered and/or blocked by GoGuardian, Securly, and similar Chrome Extensions.
<h2>History (Skip if you don't wanna read allat.)</h2>
Hack Central was created as a Google Site in 2023 with a similar goal to today. In the following year, the Google Site was removed by me and replaced with https://personality5124.github.io/hackcentral/ . This was done for more freedom on what can and can't be done on the website, and to reduce the likelyhood of being blocked, as many schools use GitHub for educational purposes.
